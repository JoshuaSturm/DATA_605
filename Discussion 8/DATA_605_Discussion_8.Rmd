Section 8.1, Page 312, Exercise 4

# Question 4
A 1-dollar bet on craps has an expected winning of $-.0141$. What does the Law of Large Numbers say about your winnings if you make a large number of 1-dollar bets at the craps table? Does it assure you that your losses will be small? Does it assure you that if n is very large you will lose?

## Solution
The Law of Large Numbers says that you will lose an average of $0.0141$ per game, so if you play a large number of games, your losses will grow. It doesn't say whether you will win or lose a game, but, as $n$ increases, your net will average out to a loss of $0.0141$ per game.

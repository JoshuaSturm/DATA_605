# 1. 
Use integration by substitution to solve the integral $\int 4e^{-7x}dx$

## 1. Solution
Let $u = -7x$. Then $du = -7 dx \ \to \ dx = \frac{du}{-7}$.

Our integral is now $\int \frac{4e^{u}du}{-7}$. Taking out the constants: $\frac{4}{-7}\int e^u du$.

Replacing $u$ with our original substitution: $\frac{-4}{7}e^{-7x} + C$.

# 2. 
Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is changing at a rate of $\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t} = -\frac{3150}{t^4} - 220$ bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where $t$ is the number of days since treatment began. Find a function $N(t)$ to estimate the level of contamination if the level after day 1 was 6530 per cubic centimeter.

## 2. Solution
\[
\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t} = -\frac{3150}{t^4} - 220 \ \to \ \text{d}N = (-\frac{3150}{t^4}-220)\text{d}t
\]

To find $N$, we can take the antiderivative, i.e. the integral.

$N = \int (-\frac{3150}{t^4}-220)\text{d}t \ \ = \int -3150(t^{-4}) \text{d}t - \int 220\text{d}t$

Using the power rule for integration: $N = \frac{-3150}{-3}(t^{-3}) - 220t + C$.

Solving for $N(1) = 6530$:

$N(1) \frac{-3150}{-3}(1^{-3}) - 220(1) + C = 6530$

$C = 6530 - 1050 + 220 = 5700$.

$N(t) = -1050(t^{-3}) - 200(t) + 5700$.

# 3.
Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the lines is $f(x) = 2x - 9$.

![](3_graph.png){width=250px}

## 3. Solution
The equation is given as $2x - 9$, and the ends of the rectangles look to be 4.5 and 8.5. Since we're looking for the area, we can integrate this function over these boundaries.

\[
\int_{4.5}^{8.5}(2x - 9)dx
\]

Using the power rule for integration:

\[
(x^2 - 9x)\Big|_{4.5}^{8.5} = \Big[(8.5)^2 - 9(8.5)\Big] - \Big[(4.5)^2 - 9(4.5)\Big]
\\
= [72.25 - 76.5] - [20.25 - 40.5] = 16
\]

# 4.
Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations

\[
y = x^2 -2x -2, \ \ \ y = x + 2
\]

## 4. Solution

```{r fourgraph}
f1 <- function(x) {x^2 - 2*x - 2}
f2 <- function(x) {x + 2}
funcShaded <- function(x) {
    y <- f1(x)
    y[x < -1 | x > 4] <- NA
    return(y)
}


ggplot(data.frame(x=c(-1, 4)), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = funcShaded, geom = "polygon", fill = "grey", alpha = 0.7) +
  stat_function(fun = f1, geom = "line", aes(colour = "f1")) +
  stat_function(fun = f2, geom = "line", aes(colour = "f2"))
```

We're looking for the area between the two functions. The intersection points are (-1, 1) and (4, 6), which will serve as the boundaries.

\[
A = \int_{-1}^{4} x + 2 \ dx  \ - \ \int_{-1}^{4}x^2 - 2x - 2 dx \\
A = \Big[\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x\Big]_{-1}^{4} - \Big[\frac{1}{3}x^3 - x^2 - 2x\Big]_{-1}^{4} \\
= -\frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{3}{2}x^2 + 4x\Big|_{-1}^{4} \\
\]

$\approx$ `r ((-1/3)*(4^3) + (3/2)*(4^2) + 4*4) - ((-1/3)*((-1)^3) + (3/2)*((-1)^2) + 4*-1)`

# 5.
A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year. It costs \$3.75 to store one flat iron for one year. There is a fixed cost of \$8.25 for each order. Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.

## 5. Solution
I was unsure how to solve this problem, so I googled how to optimize inventory, and stumbled upon [economic order quantity (EOQ).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_order_quantity)

Quoting the article:

- $P$ = purchase unit price, unit production cost
- $Q$ = order quantity.
- $Q^*$ = optimal order quantity.
- $D$ = annual demand quantity.
- $K$ = fixed cost per order, setup cost (not per unit, typically cost of ordering and shipping and handling. This is not the cost of goods)
- $h$ = annual holding cost per unit, also known as carrying cost or storage cost (capital cost, warehouse space, refrigeration, insurance, etc. usually not related to the unit production cost)

The single-item EOQ formula finds the minimum point of the following cost function:

Total Cost = purchase cost or production cost + ordering cost + holding cost

Where:

- Purchase cost: This is the variable cost of goods: purchase unit price × annual demand quantity. This is P × D
- Ordering cost: This is the cost of placing orders: each order has a fixed cost K, and we need to order D/Q times per year. This is K × D/Q
- Holding cost: the average quantity in stock (between fully replenished and empty) is Q/2, so this cost is h × Q/2

$TC = PD + \frac{DK}{Q} + \frac{hQ}{2}$.

$\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}Q} = -\frac{DK}{Q^2} + \frac{h}{2}$.

We next set this equal to zero, and solve for $Q$ in order to find the function minimum.

$-\frac{DK}{Q^2} + \frac{h}{2} = 0$.

$Q^{*2} = \frac{2DK}{h} \ \to \ Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2DK}{h}}$

We are given these variables, so we just need to plug them into the formula.

$D = 110$.

$K = 8.25$.

$h = 3.75$.

\[
Q^* = \sqrt{\frac{2\cdot 110\cdot 8.25}{3.75}} = \sqrt{\frac{1815}{3.75}} = \sqrt{484} = 22.
\]

We found 22 to be the lot size per order.

We are given that the store expects to sell $n = 110$ flat irons. If there are $x$ number of irons in each order, our equation is $22\cdot x = 110 \ \to \ x = \frac{110}{22} = 5$.

So to minimize inventory costs, the store should make 5 orders of 22 irons per year.

# 6.
Use integration by parts to solve the integral below:
\[
\int \ln(9x)\cdot x^6 \ dx
\]

## 6. Solution
The formula for integration by parts is:
\[
\int u \ dv = uv - \int v \ du
\]

Let $u = \ln(9x)$. Using the chain rule $du = \frac{1}{9x} \cdot 9 \ dx = \frac{1}{x} \ dx$.

Let $dv = x^6$, then $v = \int x^6 = \frac{x^7}{7}$.

Plugging this into the formula:

\[
\ln(9x)\cdot \frac{x^7}{7} - \int \frac{x^7}{7}\cdot \frac{1}{x} \ dx
\]

We can pull out the constant:

\[
\ln(9x)\cdot \frac{x^7}{7} - \frac{1}{7} \int \frac{x^7}{x} \ dx = \ln(9x)\cdot \frac{x^7}{7} - \frac{1}{7} \int x^6 \ dx
\]

Using the power rule for integration:

\[
\ln(9x)\cdot \frac{x^7}{7} - \frac{1}{7} \Big(\frac{x^7}{7}\Big) + C
\]

\[
= \ln(9x)\cdot \frac{x^7}{7} - \frac{x^7}{49} + C
\]

# 7.
Determine whether $f(x)$ is a probability density function on the interval $[1, e^6]$. If not, determine the value of the definite integral.

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{6x}
\]

## 7. Solution
There are two conditions for a probability density function:

- $f(x) \geq 0 \ \ \ \forall x$
- $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x) \ dx = 1$

\[
\int_{1}^{e^6} \frac{1}{6x} \ dx = \frac{1}{6} \int_{1}^{e^6}\frac{1}{x} \ dx \\
= \frac{1}{6}[\ln(x)]_{1}^{e^6} \\
= \frac{\ln(e^6) - \ln(1)}{6} = \frac{6\cdot \ln(e) - 0}{6} = \frac{6}{6} = 1
\]

Since the area sums up to 1, we conclude that $f(x)$ is a pdf on the interval $[1, e^6]$.

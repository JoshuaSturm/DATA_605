Section 5.1, Exercise 7, Page 197

# 7. A die is rolled until the first time $T$ that a six turns up

## (a) What is the probability distribution for $T$?

### Solution
Since we're looking for the first success, $T$ is a geometric random variable, with a distribution (density) of $P(T = n) = p\cdot(1-p)^{n-1} \ \ \ \ \ n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$

$P(T = n) = (\frac{1}{6})\cdot(\frac{5}{6})^{n-1} \ \ \ \ \ n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$.

## (b) Find $P(T > 3)$

### Solution
From Example 5.1, we find that $P(T > 3) = (1-p)^{3} = (\frac{5}{6})^{3} = \frac{125}{216} \approx$ `r round(125/216, 2)`.

## (c) Find $P(T > 6|T > 3)$

### Solution
Also from Example 5.1, we find that $P(T > 6| T > 3) = \frac{P(T > 6)}{P(T > 3)} = \frac{\frac{5}{6}^{6}}{\frac{5}{6}^{3}} = (\frac{5}{6})^{3} = \frac{125}{216} \approx$ `r round(125/216, 2)`.

# Question 1
Smith is in jail and has 1 dollar; he can get out on bail if he has 8 dollars.
A guard agrees to make a series of bets with him. If Smith bets A dollars,
he wins A dollars with probability .4 and loses A dollars with probability .6.
Find the probability that he wins 8 dollars before losing all of his money if

## (a) he bets 1 dollar each time (timid strategy).

##(b) he bets, each time, as much as possible but not more than necessary to bring his fortune up to 8 dollars (bold strategy).

## (c) Which strategy gives Smith the better chance of getting out of jail?

# Solutions

This is known as the Gambler's Ruin problem. 

We are given:

Initial stake $z = k = 1$.

$M = 8$

$P = 0.4$

$q = 0.6$

$q_z = \frac{(\frac{q}{p})^z - 1}{(\frac{q}{p})^M - 1}$

## (a) 

$q_z = \frac{(\frac{0.6}{0.4})^1 - 1}{(\frac{0.6}{0.4})^8 - 1} =$ `r (0.6/0.4 - 1)/((0.6/0.4)^8 - 1)`.

There is a ~2% probability Smith will win using this strategy.

## (b)

The quickest strategy is if he bets everything each time. That is, beginning from state $z = k = 1$, he can move fall to 0 with $q = 0.6$, or rise to 2 with $p = 0.4$. Similarly, suppose he moved to 2, he bets everything, and can fall to 0 with $q = 0.6$, or rise to 4 with $p = 0.4$.

Using the formula $q_k = p\cdot q_{k+1} + q\cdot q{k-1}$:

$q_0 = 0$

$q_1 = (0.4)q_2 + (0.6)q_0$

$q_2 = (0.4)q_4 + (0.6)q_0$

$q_4 = (0.4)q_8 + (0.6)q_0$

$q_8 = 1$

$(0.4)^3 =$ `r (0.4)^3`.
